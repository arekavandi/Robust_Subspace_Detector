+ Performance of proposed tests compared to the MSD, Wald, Huber based Rao in point mass noise scenario, (a) epsilon=15%, PFa=2% and α=0.75, (b) epsilon=15%, SNR=−10dB and α=0.75

+ Performance of Proposed robust LRT in different contamination levels of point mass noise scenario as a function of α, when the probability of false alarm is fixed to 10% and SNR=−10dB.
